Resale value preditcion Using Watson Auto AI
Project Description:
With difficult economic conditions, it is likely that sales of second-hand imported
(reconditioned) cars and used cars will increase. In many developed countries, it is common to
lease a car rather than buying it outright. A lease is a binding contract between a buyer and a
seller (or a third party â€“ usually a bank, insurance firm or other financial institutions) in which
the buyer must pay fixed instalments for a pre-defined number of months/years to the
seller/financer. After the lease period is over, the buyer has the possibility to buy the car at its
residual value, i.e. its expected resale value. Thus, it is of commercial interest to seller/financers
to be able to predict the salvage value (residual value) of cars with accuracy.
